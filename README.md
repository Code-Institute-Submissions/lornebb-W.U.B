## UX

### Project Goals

Writers Unblock is designed to give an artist a little push through barriers that they commonly face. The goal is to provide a non-nonsense, almost instant injection of creativity, or reassurance. It is designed to be easily usable and readable.  

### Target Audience Goals

#### Target audience

* music writers
* music composers
* novelists
* short story
* TTRPG Game Masters

#### User Goals

* A website that can be operated by a guitarist with a guitar in one hand, and a plectrum coiled in the other, with only one finger available for tapping.
* A website that can be operated by a writer with a pen in one hand and their phone / tablet in the other.
* A pick up and go source for Games Masters who create on the fly.
* Simple and complicated chord sequence generators.
* Simple and complicated, in key, melody generator.
* Direct contact for feature requests.
* No frills, easy to navigate design.
* Easily recognisable on all browser sizes. 

#### User Stories

##### Mr. Bloggs

<em>As a composer and pianist I expect a site that can generate both melody and harmony, in key, instantly, and flexibly.</em>

##### Ms. C. Thweepioh

<em>As a games master, when I run games and have to imporovise, I need an instant and varied source of charcter names, places, pets etc.</em>

##### They Maplecourt

<em>As a lyricist, I make lyrics all day, every day of the week. Sometimes I need to make sure that what I make is mine, without sifting through unrelated search results.</em>

#### Site Owner Goals

* Provide results easily and effortlessly to writers.
* Maintain a level of theoretical stability in the generation of musical chords and melody.
* Not to collect, or try to claim, any ownership, credit, contact details or watermarking of content provided to any final product that emerges from the results generated on the site.

## User Requirements and Expectations

#### User Requirements:

* Easy buttons to sections.
* Familiar navbar as to not get lost or confused about where they are.
* Instant and varied results from each generation
* Only song lyrics to be searched and returned in lyric search. 

#### User Expectations

* Varied enough results every time, so if initial generation result is not satisfactory, the next one should not appear familiar to its predecessor.
* Text bars are copy and paste friendly
* Site should be accessable on all browsers from mobile to desktop.
* Any feature suggestions to go direct to developer. 

## Design Choices

This is purely functional web application, design is feature focused, and style comes second. I went for a relatively light background to keep the focus on the darker content. Large active buttons used for generations of content.

##### Fonts

The font used is called <a href=http://fonts3.com/fonts/k/Krungthep.html>Krungthep</a> which looks as mechanical as possible without appearing too comical or ironic. Which goes with the purely functional theme I'm applying site-wide. The focus is to provide short, highly literal, informative information to the user so as to not distract from what's important - the content generation.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 

### Existing Features

* Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
* ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

* Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

* Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
* Different configuration files?
* Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
